In this project I am collecting my personal implementations of algorithms written in the Go programming language. The algorithms come from the O'Reilly book "Algorithms in a Nutshell", hence the name 'GoNuts'.

Since this is my private little project, feel free to use whatever you find useful but don't expect anything.

run with a command such as:
gotest -test.run="." -test.v=true -test.bench="."
